# MiniLang Scanner in Python with PLY

This project implements a scanner for a simple language called MiniLang using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). The scanner identifies and classifies tokens like keywords (if, else, print), operators (+, -, *), variables, and numbers from MiniLang source code.

The included code demonstrates the scanner's functionality and allows you to test it by entering MiniLang statements.
